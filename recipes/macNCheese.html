        <h3>Spicy One Pot Mac and Cheese</h3>
        <p>
            This easy one pot mac and cheese is loaded with spicy paste(‘nduja or gochujang) to make a supercharged, gooey, saucy mac and cheese with no need to make a roux, no butter and no flour. Just add everything into a pot and let the magical pasta starch do all the heavy lifting.
            This technique for mac and cheese is truly a game-changer. Usually, you need to make a cheesy bechamel sauce, cook the pasta separately, and then add everything together. This way, all you have to do is add everything into one pot and stir. 20 minutes max, and you’re done.
            The secret? Starch. As the pasta cooks, the starch releases into the cooking liquid, naturally thickening the sauce without having to add anything else. Starch is why you should always add a little pasta cooking water to your finished pasta dishes to thicken the sauce up and make it nice and glossy. And we’re using it to its full potential here. It also means fewer dishes which is always a win in my mind!
            ‘Nduja paste is the magic ingredient that takes this mac and cheese to another level. This funky, umami-packed spreadable salami from Calabria just delivers so much flavor. It’s spicy, meaty and truly delicious. I also LOVE using gochujang paste here – either works beautifully.
